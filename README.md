# BEAM Visual Notation

This repository contains everything necessary to graphically model AI systems in the BEAM visual notation.
Resources for the semantic representation of BEAM can be found [here](https://semsys.ai.wu.ac.at/beam/). Two-way transformations between models in the visual notation and the semantic representation are currently being worked on.
BEAM follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
