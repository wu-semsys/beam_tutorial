# BEAM Notation

This repository contains everything necessary to graphically model (hybrid) AI systems in the BEAM notation.

For a quick start see the [Instructions PDF](./BEAMv3-instructions.pdf). More detailed documentation can be found in the [User Manual](./beam_technical_documentation_v3.md).

The file [beam_lib_v3.xml](./beam_lib_v3.xml) contains the latest version of the draw.io library. An example diagram of a simple ML-based system can be found [here](./beam_v3_example_fashion_attire_classfication.xml).

Files of previous versions of the BEAM notation can be found in the folder beam_v2.
